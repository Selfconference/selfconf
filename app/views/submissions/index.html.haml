        %p All speakers will receive a free ticket to the conference. We have a smaller budget than last year, but are happy to talk about the availability of covering travel expenses with anyone interested. Please reach out to Amber at amber@selfconference.org to discuss.
        %p All submissions are anonymized and then selected by a panel of volunteers. Please refrain from using identifying information in your titles, abstracts, and notes to the panel.
